#Figure Out Rotation

* calculate final position based on rotation
* test orbs between start and finish & find first collision
* find linear distance travelled for orb to reach that position
* calculate collision point
* test orbs along following route:
initial position is where the orbs were previously
final position is where the orbs would be if rotation was fully applied and the object was then translated backwards to the calculated collision point
* in the event of a 2nd collision, go back and
