Final size goal: 5 or 6 levels until the player arrives at their destination
then a separate sandbox area, and the surfboard + its own 5-6 level campaign. extra unlockable variants of both vehicles, more animals, etc.
a couple secret areas in each level including the sandbox
paywall all of that except the entire pogo campaign and about half of the sandbox, possibly with previously discussed asynchronous multiplayer elements

I want to capture old source game feel. I should make the UI more like those games to capture that feel

I want to make the story feel like half life 1. you aren't forced to watch the story. the story unfolds in front of you

NPC Dialog shouldn't take up much of the screen. NPCs should follow the player through a few checkpoints to spout their exposition, instead of trying to get it all in one place.

the player should be a silent protagonist but it should be clear what their desires are from the player's actions. they want to go on this quest, although the exact nature of the quest isn't revealed

maybe your parents wishes you well as you leave the house, the skater asks where you are going

second vehicle idea: surfboard. brings to life the airstrafing part of movement, but with little control of when you leave the ground

pipe dream one day a multiplayer pvp game where the player has both a pogo stick and surfboard and uses projectile weapons and very large melee

volume control

Trail Recording & displaying tool

crazy checkpoint effects!!! as you get to further checkpoints, especially really difficult ones, add crazy checkpoint effects. get to this level: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_lVSrPB6w
